# Used-Cars-Price-Prediction
Welcome to the Loan Approval Prediction project!
Markup 
* Developed a machine learning model capable of predicting the prices of used cars.. 
* This model has been trained on a comprehensive dataset that includes a wide range of parameters that significantly impact the determination of a car's price. 
* It is designed to identify and understand the underlying patterns that affect the pricing decisions for cars.
# Data
The dataset contains various attributes and associated information used to determine a car's optimal resale value. It encompasses a wide range of variables, including the car's make and model, production year, selling price, mileage, fuel type, and the total distance it has been driven.
